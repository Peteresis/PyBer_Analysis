# PyBer Analysis

## 1. Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

The goal of this challenge is to provide ridesharing data visualizations for PyBer in order to promote access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underprivileged neighborhoods.

The study is based on data obtained in the form of a CSV file from PyBer. This data has been processed using Python's Pandas to produce a summary dataframe (shown below) as well as a chart generated using the information in the dataframe to visualize the data.


## 2. Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type
